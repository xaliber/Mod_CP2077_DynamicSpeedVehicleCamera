# Dynamic Speed Vehicle Camera

This mod automatically picks your camera perspective based on your vehicle speed (see video).

Slowest speed will auto-switch you to first person view camera; fastest speed will auto-switch you to farthest third person camera. Speed value is configurable via Mod Settings menu. The mod smartly adjusts max speed based on your driving (the value resets after you leave the vehicle).

If you dislike auto-switching to first person camera, you can disable it in the Mod Settings menu.

There is an optional Vehicle Combat Camera option to configure which camera perspective you should default to when entering combat state while driving. The camera will pause its dynamic transition and automatically switch to specific distance of your choosing.
